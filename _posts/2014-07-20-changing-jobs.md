After almost 12 years, I've decided to change jobs... Wish me luck!

-----

I worked at a bank for almost 12 years. After this time, I went after that elusive thing: to work at an organisation that I believe is very well aligned with my own ideas about software development, [OutSystems](http://www.outsystems.com). I almost took this step 8 years ago. I'll now find out if I made the right decision at the time.

Not sure if I'll have the time - two small kids, moonlighting as [InfoQ editor](http://www.infoq.com/author/Jo√£o-Miranda), new job - but my intention is to write about my experience at OutSystems and as a software development _afficionado_.

Enjoy...
